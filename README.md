## previous stack: ajax-jquery-html-sqlite

## now
1. backend use express-node, not using any big framework
2. database: mongodb, tried to use sqlite, but node doesn't support it well
3. no frontend: still use ajax-jquery, in the future, may change it to java+axios, or use some frontend framework like vue or react.
